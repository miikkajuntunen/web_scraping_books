# Recipe Scraping Project 
Automated the process of scraping book data from 50 pages of the Skinnytaste website. The goal was to extract useful information such as calories, personal points, and recipe summaries, and to provide insights into the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The task also involves creating an interactive interface that allows users to filter recipes based on their preferred calorie and point ranges.
